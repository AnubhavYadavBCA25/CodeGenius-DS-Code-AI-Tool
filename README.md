# CodeGenius: DS Code AI Tool 

## ðŸ“– Project Introduction

DS-CodeGenius is a specialized tool for data scientists that streamlines the entire data science workflow. It goes beyond generic code generators by focusing on practical challenges like data cleaning, transformation, debugging, and documentation.

**The tool leverages Generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to:**
- Generate optimized Python/SQL code from natural language.
- Debug errors with clear explanations and fixes.
- Suggest best practices for performance and reproducibility.
- Automatically create docstrings, comments, and narrative reports.

Designed to integrate directly with environments like Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code, or a web UI, DS-CodeGenius reduces repetitive work and context-switching, allowing data scientists to focus more on insights and decision-making rather than boilerplate coding.
